  content : "For all my life, I have been enamored with art, and for the rest of my life, I want to learn and have the chance to produce it. Art, however, is not just paintings or sculptures. Art can found under the veil of countless human activities. While visual arts have been the core of my passion since I was three, I have learned, as I have grown, the art of numerical values and patterns. I am fascinated by the way numbers weave together, forming an array of mathematical formulas that make up the tapestry of science. This is why I strive to pursue a career in finance and accounting. "
