Hello Everyone! Welcome to my website!

To describe myself, I would like to use three terms my friends always describe me as:

**Artistic Businesswoman** 
Art, for me, is **not** just paintings or sculptures. Art can found under the veil of countless human activities. While visual arts have been the core of my passion since I was three, as I grew up, I have learned art is in every subject. If you look at Accounting, you will always find balance between the left side and right side of the balance sheet. It is the same as you can always find the concept of balance in the art pieces. And in the subject of Finance, it is interesting to quantify a company’s value as numbers weave together and form those mathematical models.I am fascinated by the way numbers weave together, forming an array of mathematical formulas that make up the tapestry of science. This is why I strive to pursue a career in finance and accounting. 

**Productive CPU** 
Being efficient grants me the most happiness in life. I will give you an example. Each morning before going to school, I need to do different tasks. For example, washing clothes, preparing breakfasts for my cats as well as for myself, and disposing garbage. You don’t want to get up too early since you want more sleep, but you also want to complete those tasks. Time management skills are very important in this case. You need to decide which task you should do first. For instance, you want to wash clothes at first. And you can boil the water for dumplings while you fetch the cats’ food. It’s a daily life example, but the skill is detrimental for school and career. You need to know which projects or assignments take more time and which one is more urgent. 

**Rational Shopaholic**
Just as the same as other girls, I love buying luxury goods. Unlike most of the girls, who buy luxury goods because of their appearances or because they want to show off, I only buy for quality and culture. For instance, I really love a British brand-named Stella McCartney. The brand is very low-key. And the designer herself is an animal rights activist. She never the materials of leather or wool. Instead, the brand innovates ways to create and use sustainable materials. 

Besides these, I have two lovely cats---Aeolus and Zelus. You can find their lovely pictures below.
