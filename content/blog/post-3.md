title: Investment Fundamentals Project--Kelly Criterion
---

Our group had a meeting today about what we want to do for the investment fundamentals project, which requires us to come up with our own investment strategy. Bryce introduced us about Kelly Criterion, a new concept which I have never heard of and I would like to share this with you. 

Kelly criterion, is introduced by John  Larry Kelly Jr in 1956 and was known as a gambling strategy.  It is often used to calculate what is the optimal bet size when you know your reward for your bet. And here is the formula:

*Kelly %*=W−[(1−W)/R]

where:

Kelly %= Percent of investor’s capital to put into a single trade

W=Historical win percentage of trading system

R=Trader’s historical win/loss ratio


What's more interesting about kelly criterion is that it can actually be used for asset allocations. It can be used to help calculate the weight of each risky asset for our investment portfolio. Thus, our group decided to use Kelly Criterion to design our investment strategy, together with other strategies to protect the tail risk. I will update this blog after we finish the entire project!
