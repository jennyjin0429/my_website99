title: Celebrating National Day and Mid-autumn Festival on the same day
---

This year is so special. Firstly, it is the first year I can celebrate Mid-autumn Festival with my family. I have been studying abroad since the age of 14. And thus, I was always alone when I celebrate the festival.

More importantly, Oct.1st is also the country's National Day. It is so rare that two days fall on the same day. That's why Chinese workers have a 8-day vacation for this year. 

Would you like to know about what  often do on Mid-Autumn Festival? If you do, I will lead you to take a glimpse:

**What do we eat and drink?**
--Mooncake 

--Pumpkin

--Pomelo

--Duck
