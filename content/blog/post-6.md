title: A Trip to Yangshuo, Guilin
---

During the "National Break" in China, I travelled to Yangshuo county, which is under jurisdiction of Guilin. It is a beautiful county surrounded mountains and Li River.  

The image on the 20 RMB note is taken at Yangshuo. I took a boat and travelled on Li River, trying to capture a picture integrating both the peaks and the 20 RMB note. 

We  went to a street called West Street. It has a history of 1400 years. The street is full of restaurants and small shops selling local snacks. We got the opportunity to taste the most famous food in Yangshuo, which is fish cooked with beer. 

On the last night of our trip, we went to watch a show called "Impression Liu Sanjie." The show is the world's largest natural auditorium that uses Li River waters as its stage, with its backdrop to be twelve mist-enveloped hills. The show lasts about 70 minutes, performing by Chinese minorities group. It was marvelous!

Since it was during the break, there were people crowding on the streets. We chose to travel using bicycles. And more interestingly, I had to take class in the evening after travelling in the day, which made me felt exausted.
