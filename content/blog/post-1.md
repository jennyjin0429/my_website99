title: Learning Tidyverse and Creating my First RMarkdown
---

Througout July and August, MFA students have to learn many pre-programme courses. Among all of them, I found the datacamp courses most interesting. I learned about basic R codes to clean and manipulate data. More excitingly, I learned about how to use ggplot to create bar graphs, histogram, scatterplot and many other different types of plots. 

We also got an pre-programme assignment to do. For the first part of the assignment, we need to use R markdown to write our own bibliography. First I found it was very challenging, as I didn't know how to **bold** and how to *indent* by using R markdown. It is so different with using word, where you can format your work by using visiualized icons of tools. As I continue working, I found R Markdown as so many marvelous features. For instance, it is html compatible, allowing to knit my file to a html page. 

I really enjoy working with R Markdown and am ready to explore more as the Data analytics course starts.
