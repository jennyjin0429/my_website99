title: POP MART -- The Blind Box Economy
---

**What is Blind Box?**
The cute Alice and Wonderland toys depicted in the image above are what I got from the blind boxes series. You may not know what blind box is. They are all the same outside but they have a unique toy on the inside. These toys include many series including the Disney figures, Sanrio figures, Harry Potter figures and many other figures. That's why the boxes are called "blind boxes"(Chinese: 盲盒) as you can't tell what it is from the outside. There are typically 12 styles in a series. If you are "lucky" enough, you may keep ruffaling the same one. It's like a gambling game!

**What is POP MART?**
POP MART is a retailing company selling blind boxies. The company often cooperates with the toy designers to provide "designers's series". Interestingly, POP MART's main consumer group is not young children, but is teenagers who are between 18 and 35 years old white-collar and students, and, yes, including me.
