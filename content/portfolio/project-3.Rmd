title: GDP Components Over Time and Among Countries
---
### Project Details

For the last assignment, I am responsible for cooperating with the other group member and completing Challenge 2 of the assignment. Kostis gave us hint on the need we need to play with pivot_long and pivot_wide. At the beginning, I always got stuck after I wrote all of the codes to plot my data. But later, I discovered the reason why I got error message was because I haven't used pivot_wide to make the data in wide format. 

The challenge is also interesting because it allows me to see how different types of countries differ in their GDP components. For instance, India has the most spending in gross capital formation as it is still a developing country. 

In the analysis below, I want to compare my home country---China, with other two developing countries in Asia :India and Thailand to see what differences they have regarding to components of GDP.

```{r, setup,include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center")
```
#### First Load the Liabraries
```{r load-libraries}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(GGally)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
library(tidyquant)
library(infer)
library(openintro)
```
At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). 

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised

#### Second, we load the data.
```{r read_GDP_data}
# load the data
UN_GDP_data  <- read_excel(here::here("mydata","Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"),
sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr",
skip=2) 

```

#### Third, we tidy the data, 
as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.
```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to = 'Year', values_to = 'Value') %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% c('Gross capital formation',
'Exports of goods and services',
'Imports of goods and services',
'General government final consumption expenditure',
'Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)',
'Gross Domestic Product (GDP)')) %>%
  mutate(Value = Value/1e9) %>% 
  
#rename indicators using case_when and mutate
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(IndicatorName == 'Gross capital formation' ~ 'Gross capital formation',
  IndicatorName == 'Exports of goods and services' ~ 'Exports',
  IndicatorName == 'Imports of goods and services' ~ 'Imports',
  IndicatorName == 'General government final consumption expenditure' ~ 'Government expenditure',
  IndicatorName == 'Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)' ~ 'Household expenditure',
  IndicatorName == 'Gross Domestic Product (GDP)' ~ 'GDP_given'))

#glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

#Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("China","India", "Thailand")
```

### Make the Plot
#### First, plot the GDP compenents over the time using color.
```{r gdp1}
plot1_data <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  
  # filter for country and indicator
  filter(Country %in% country_list,
         IndicatorName != 'GDP_given') %>% 
  
  # order indicators s.t they are in the same order as in the plot
  mutate(IndicatorName = factor(IndicatorName, levels = c('Gross capital formation',
  'Exports',
  'Government expenditure',
  'Household expenditure',
  'Imports')))  

plot1_data %>%   ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Value, group = IndicatorName, color = IndicatorName), size = 0.8) +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010)) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = 'Components of GDP') +
  facet_wrap(~ Country) +
  labs(x = '',
       y = 'Billion US$',
       title = 'GDP components over time',
       subtitle = 'In constant 2010 USD') +
  theme_bw()
```
I found that China's GDP has grown tremendously since 2000, which is almost four times India's GDP. Next, I want to look deeper on the GDP components of each country. 

```{r gdp2}
tidy_GDP_data_plot2  <-  UN_GDP_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 4:51, names_to = 'Year', values_to = 'Value') %>% 
  filter(IndicatorName %in% c('Gross capital formation',
    'Exports of goods and services',
    'Imports of goods and services',
    'General government final consumption expenditure',
    'Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)',
    'Gross Domestic Product (GDP)')) %>%
  mutate(Value = Value/1e9) %>% 
  
  # rename indicators using case_when and mutate
  mutate(IndicatorName = case_when(IndicatorName == 'Gross capital formation' ~ 'I',
  IndicatorName == 'Exports of goods and services' ~ 'X',
  IndicatorName == 'Imports of goods and services' ~ 'IM',
  IndicatorName == 'General government final consumption expenditure' ~ 'G',
  IndicatorName == 'Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)' ~ 'C',
  IndicatorName == 'Gross Domestic Product (GDP)' ~ 'GDP_given')) %>%
  
  # Arrange the data in wide format
   pivot_wider(names_from='IndicatorName',values_from='Value') %>%
  
  # Create a variable called Net Exports 
   mutate(NX=X-IM) %>%
  
  # Calculate proportion
   mutate('Government Expenditure'=G/GDP_given,'Gross capital formation'=I/GDP_given,
          'Household Expenditure'=C/GDP_given,'Net Exports'=NX/GDP_given) %>%
  
   select(1:3,9:14) %>%
  
  # Make the data into long format again
  pivot_longer(cols='Government Expenditure':'Net Exports',names_to='IndicatorName',values_to='proportions')
 
  

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("China","India", "Thailand")

tidy_GDP_data_plot2 %>%
  
  # filter for country and indicator
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  
  # order indicators s.t they are in the same order as in the plot
  mutate(IndicatorName = factor(IndicatorName, levels = c('Government Expenditure',
                                                          'Gross capital formation',
                                                          'Household Expenditure',
                                                          'Net Exports'))) %>% 
  # Code for the plot
  ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = proportions, group = IndicatorName, color = IndicatorName), size = 0.8) +
  
  #adjust the scale
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010)) +
  
  #adjust scale color
  scale_color_discrete(name = 'Components of GDP') +
  facet_wrap(~ Country) +
  labs(x = '',
       y = 'proportion',
       title = 'GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars',
       caption = 'Source:United Nations,https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snamma/Downloads')  + 
  
  #adjust decimal place on y-axis 
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent)+
  
  theme_bw()
```

#### Conclusion and Findings
What I found is that developing countries in Asia have similar component structure. The tend to have lower percent net export and about 20% government expenditure. Another similarity is that the household expenditure has a trend of downward sloping, comparing to the upward sloping of developed country. For China and India, they spend a significant portion on gross capital formation, which might be investments on infrastructure for future development. One interesting fact regarding to Thailand is that it has the greatest percentage amongst the three on net exports. Based on my research, Thailand is rich of wood and fruits. Besides the resources, the cheap labour also makes Thailand a popular place for manufacturers.
