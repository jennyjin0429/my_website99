title: GDP Components Over Time and Among Countries
---



<div id="project-details" class="section level4">
<h4>Project Details</h4>
<p>For the last assignment, I am responsible for cooperating with the other group member and completing Challenge 2 of the assignment. Kostis gave us hint on the need we need to play with pivot_long and pivot_wide. At the beginning, I always got stuck after I wrote all of the codes to plot my data. But later, I discovered the reason why I got error message was because I havenâ€™t used pivot_wide to make the data in wide format.</p>
<p>The challenge is also interesting because it allows me to see how different types of countries differ in their GDP components. For instance, India has the most spending in gross capital formation as it is still a developing country.</p>
