title: Eastern Asian countries tend to have lower happiness score
---
### Project Detail
Although people are rich of resources today and most of us don't have to worry about food and clothing. But there are a lot of people feeling unhappy. I notice this happens especially in China. Many people around me seems depressed. This dataset is provided by professor Kostis in section 7. When I took a glimpse onto the data, I was not surprised to find that China ranked the 84th place. Therefore, I decided to look further into the data to see how China ranks compared to other developing country. 

```{r, setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="medium")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=9.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

#### Load Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(GGally)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(huxtable)
library(ggthemes)
library(skimr)
```

#### Import Dataset
```{r}
world_happiness_15 <- read_csv(here("mydata", "world_happiness_2015.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

#### Inspect Dataset
```{r}
glimpse(world_happiness_15)
#Look at China's ranking
world_happiness_15 %>% filter (country=="China")
```
>We can see China ranks at approximately the middle among 158 countries even though it is the second largest economy in the world. So what variable decides happiness? Let's do a correlation matrix next.

#### produce scatterplot-correlation matrix using GGally::ggpairs()
```{r}
world_happiness_15 %>% 
  select(-c(country, region, happiness_rank, standard_error)) %>% 
  ggpairs()
```
Based on the correlation matrix, I found that happiness score is highly correlated with family, life expenctancy and gdp_per_capita. 

#### produce sumamry statistics for happiness score
```{r}
world_happiness_15 %>% 
  select(happiness_score) %>% 
  skim()
```

#### Which region has the lowest happiness score?
```{r}
by_region <- world_happiness_15 %>% 
# Group the observations by region 
  group_by(region) %>% 
# Calculate the average within the group 
  summarise(avg_happiness_score=mean(happiness_score))%>%
# Arrange the average in descending order
  arrange(desc(avg_happiness_score))
```
#### Plot the average happiness score by region
```{r}
ggplot(by_region, 
       aes(x = avg_happiness_score, 
           y = reorder(region,avg_happiness_score)),fill=region)+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  labs(title = "Which region has the highest happiness score?", 
        x="Happiness_score",y="Region") +
  theme_economist()
```

>We found Australia and New Zealand region has the highest average happiness_score. Comapring to North Americans, Eastern Asian tends to have lower happpiness_score. 
According to William Tov's research, the reason why East Asians tend to have lower levels of well-being is because of culture difference. He argues that "culture influences how we seek happiness and regulate our emotions: European Americans typically want to feel peppy emotions like excitement and cheerfulness, while Hong Kong Chinese prefer calmer states like peace and serenity. Even the factors that promote happiness may be different, as self-esteem is more important to our feelings of life satisfaction in the West than in East Asia. "

#### Are people from the same region (Eastern Asia) also feel unhappy?
Create a Graph Comparing Different Countries in East Asia Region
```{r}
world_happiness_east_asia <- world_happiness_15 %>%

  #filter the dataset  
  filter (region=="Eastern Asia")
 
  #plot the data
  ggplot(world_happiness_east_asia, 
       aes(x = happiness_score, 
           y = reorder(country,happiness_score)))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  labs(title = "Taiwan has the highest happiness score.", 
        x="Happiness_score",y="Country") +
  theme_economist()
  
  
```
From the list, we can see that smaller countries like Taiwan, Japan and Korea tend to have higher happiness score. According to a new analysis published by the Global Wellness, smaller countries tend to feel happier because they have a healthier lifestyle and live longer. For those countries who are large and rapidly developing, their citizens tend to experience high rate of depression, alcohol misuse and other health issues. 
#### Lets see the relationship between happiness score and life expectancy.
```{r}
model1 <- lm(happiness_score ~ 1, data = world_happiness_15)
model2 <- lm(happiness_score ~ health_life_expectancy, data = world_happiness_15)
# get model summary
model2 %>% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)
model2 %>% broom::glance()
```
We can find a high t stat and the confidence interval doesn't include zero. Therefore, we can conclude that life expectancy is a variable highly correlated with happiness.

```{r}
ggplot(world_happiness_15,
       aes(x=health_life_expectancy,y=happiness_score,color=region,size=economy_gdp_per_capita)) +
  geom_point()+
# add best fit line
  geom_smooth(color="black")
# add labels 
  labs(title = "Taiwan has the highest happiness score.", 
        x="Life Expectancy",y="Happiness Score") +
  theme_economist()
```
