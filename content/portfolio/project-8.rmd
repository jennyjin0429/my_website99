title: How often do people search for Cupcake?
---

#### Project Requirements
I am a super fan of sweet food, and yes, including cupcake. I have learned that Google has publicized some dataset regarding to search term data tracking by its powerful engine. It shows us how often people are searching for and when. You can explore statistics on search volume for almost any search term since 2004. Enter in any search term, or a handful of search terms, and click the download button to analyze the data outside of the Trends website. If you interested, go on this website :https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%2Fm%2F03p1r4&date=all

I select "cupcake" as a term to do my analysis. 

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

```

#### load libaries
```{r load-libraries}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
library(dplyr)
```

### Plot of Trend Over Time

#### Load and Tidy the data.
```{r}
# load the data
MultiTimeline  <- read_csv(here::here("mydata","multiTimeline.csv")) %>%
               clean_names() 

# tidy the data
tidytimeline <- MultiTimeline%>%
 
  #rename variables 
  rename(months= `yue_fen`) %>%
  rename(search_count=`zhi_bei_dan_gao_quan_qiu`) %>%
  mutate(date=paste(months, "-01", sep=""))

tidytimeline$date <- as.Date(tidytimeline$date)

         
# look at the variable
glimpse(tidytimeline)
```

#### Plot the data
```{r}
ggplot(tidytimeline,aes(x=date,y=search_count))+
 # plot using line plot 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title= "How often do people search for Cupcake?",
       x="date",
       y="search count")+
   theme_economist()

```

> I found that during the period between 2010-2015, the search for "cupcake" increases tremendously. Many drama shows trigure the rise of popularity of cupcakes. In Sex and the City, the ladies meet to have cup cakes every two weeks.Another show is called "2 Broke Girls", which was produced for Warner brothers. The show depicts the story for Caroline and Max. The two girls dream of owning a cupcake business and they raise money to first launch Max's Homemade Cupcakes.The show introduced me to cupcakes and I still remember I was looking for different cupcake shops when I studied in Vancouver.
And the downfall of cupcake may due to the reason that many new sweet foods are introduced, for example, Macaroons. 

### Search count grouped by Region
#### Load and Tidy the data.
```{r}
library(mapdata)
# load the data
geoMap  <- read_csv(here::here("mydata","geoMap.csv")) %>%
               clean_names() %>%
               na.omit()

world_map <- map_data("world")
glimpse(geoMap)
```
#### Merge dataset and Make a choropleth plot
```{r}
tidyMap <- geoMap %>%
  rename(region=`country`)%>%
  rename(count = `cupcake_01_01_2004_17_10_2020`) 
# Merge data
world_map <- map_data("world")
tidyMap2 <- left_join (tidyMap, world_map, by = "region")
#create the plot
ggplot(tidyMap2, aes(long, lat, group = group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = count ), color = "white")+
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C") +
  labs(title="Oceania People Like to Search for Cupcake the Most",x="latitude",y="longitude")
```

> I found that Oceania people, including Australia and Newzeland tend to search cupcake most often, followed by North American and South American countries. Asian countries seem not search for cupcake that often. That is probably because they don't have a culture of cupcake.
