#### Project Requirements
In this project, I got the chance to play with pivot_long and pivot_wide and learn how those two magic functions help when we try to plot the data. 

If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

```
load libaries
```{r load-libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(mosaic)
library(ggthemes)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
library(httr)
library(readxl)
library(vroom)
```

Run the code below to load the file:
```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```


#### Convert the dataframe 
from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.

```{r tidyweather}
weather_cleaned <- weather %>% select(1:13)
tidyweather <- weather_cleaned %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13,names_to="month",values_to="delta")

```
#### Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 
```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year),month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (title = "Weather Anomalies")

```
Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 
```{r facet_wrap}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +facet_wrap(~month)
  theme_bw() +
  labs (title = "Weather Anomalies")

```

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.
```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +  
  theme_bw() +               
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

We might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta")                         

```
## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>% filter(interval=="2011-present")%>%
  summarise(mean_delta=mean(delta,na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_delta=sd(delta,na.rm=TRUE),
            count=n(),
            se=sd_delta/sqrt(count),upper_95=mean_delta+1.96*se,
            lower_95=mean_delta-1.96*se)

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

library ("infer")
boot_delta <-comparison %>% filter(interval=="2011-present") %>%
specify(response=delta) %>%
  generate (reps=500,type="bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat="mean")
percentile_ci <- boot_delta %>% get_confidence_interval(level=0.95,type="percentile")
percentile_ci
```

> Analysis of Data:
By looking at the weather annual anomalies graph and the annual anomalies graph faceted by month, we can see a upward trend of delta. Despite there were some cycles and downward trend before 1970s, the trend line is a positive-slope line, surpassing 1 at present. And then by looking at the density plot, we can see the plots are all normal distribution but there is rightward trend of the plot of different time periods, which demonstrates the increasing trend of the mean of delta.Lastly, when we calculate the confidence interval for average annual delta since 2011, we are 95% confident that the average annual delta falls within the range between 0.922 and 1.01. Based on those fildings, we can conclude that the temperature deviation(delta)is greater than 0, thus there is evidence of global warming. And the temperature is also likely keeps increasing in the future.
